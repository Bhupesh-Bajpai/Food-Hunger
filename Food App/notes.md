# props

>> function arguments in js and attributes in html that we pass inside component we also said it is js object
>> when you dynamically pass the data in component then we pass as props.

# config driven ui

# index in react
>> don't use index as key that is bad practice
   {resData.map((restaurant,index) =>
                    <RestraContainer key=
                    {index} data={restaurant} />
                )}
